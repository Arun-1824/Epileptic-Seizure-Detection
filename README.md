"# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection" 

Tech Stack: 🐍 Python, 🧠 Deep Learning (LSTM)

Leveraged Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to automatically learn and identify discriminative EEG features for epileptic seizure detection. This approach enabled the system to manage non-stationary EEG signals and adapt to varying patterns, enhancing reliability in seizure detection and contributing to improved patient quality of life. 💡
